# trailerswidget

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of trailerswidget is to create a completely modular shiny application in the structure of a package.  This is a proof of concept to see if other applications can later be migrated to this same structure

## Installation

You can install the released version of trailerswidget from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("trailerswidget")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(trailerswidget)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:


```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)

```
